;; Here is a playground for implementing the latest version of the
;; API, r0.3.0.  Confusingly, "v1" of the API is older and more
;; primitive than "r0".  Apparently the API was not considered
;; "released" then, and now it is, so the versions are named with an R
;; instead of a V.

;; TODO: Consider let-binding `json-array-type' to `list'.  I'm not
;; sure there's any advantage to using vectors, and it makes the code
;; more error-prone because some things are lists and some vectors.

Every TIMEOUT seconds, the server should return any outstanding

  ;; https://matrix.org/docs/spec/client_server/r0.2.0.html#id126

  ;; TODO: Probably should add a watchdog in case the server drops the connection and doesn't
  ;; actually return when timed-out.  We should be able to check the `symbol-status' arg to the
  ;; callback, and if it's `timeout' or `abort', we call /sync again.  That would let us avoid
  ;; using a timer.  To do this, we also need to set the timeout arg to `request' to, say, a
  ;; few seconds more than the timeout sent in the API request.

  ;; MAYBE: Don't make new /sync request if timeout is 0/nil.  It would have to be passed
  ;; through to the callback.

  ;; MAYBE: Can we just set the :complete arg to `request' to `matrix-sync' so that it will be
  ;; called repeatedly?  Or should we call `matrix-sync' again in the success callback?  Do we
  ;; want to stop syncing if there's an error?

  ;; NOTE: I guess we should stop syncing if there's an error, because otherwise, if next-batch
  ;; doesn't get updated, it will call sync repeatedly to get the same batch of data that's
  ;; failing, and likely enter an infinite loop (an asynchronous one, at least).  So we'll call
  ;; `matrix-sync' again in the success callback.

  ;; FIXME: Need to handle gaps according to the API: "Normally, all new events which are
  ;; visible to the client will appear in the response to the /sync API. However, if a large
  ;; number of events arrive between calls to /sync, a \"limited\" timeline is returned,
  ;; containing only the most recent message events. A state \"delta\" is also returned,
  ;; summarising any state changes in the omitted part of the timeline. The client may
  ;; therefore end up with \"gaps\" in its knowledge of the message timeline. The client can
  ;; fill these gaps using the /rooms/<room_id>/messages API. This situation looks like this:"

  ;; So IIUC, we need to see if "limited" is true FOR EACH ROOM, and if so, get the
  ;; "prev_batch" token FOR THAT ROOM and call `matrix-messages' with it.  But it seems that we
  ;; also need to call it with an "end" token, which I guess should be the "next_batch" token
  ;; from the last non-limited /sync request (which starts to get confusing).  The API docs
  ;; aren't especially clear here.  NOTE: I guess this will be difficult or impossible to test,
  ;; because I don't know how often the server returns limited timelines (i.e. how busy a room
  ;; has to be), or how we could make it do so, because there is no "limit" param for /sync.

  ;; I think what I will do for now is just raise a warning if "limited" is ever set.

  ;; The /messages call does NOT return a "limited", so I guess there is no way to know when
  ;; you've retrieved all of the messages that /sync WOULD have sent you if there were no
  ;; limit.  So I guess we have to decide for ourselves how many messages we want to show on
  ;; initial sync, and fetch backward until we have that many--unless, of course, we hit the
  ;; beginning of the room, in which case I guess the start/end tokens from /messages will be
  ;; the same...?  Or we'll receive fewer messages than the limit...?
